# Practice Project - Responsive Website with Bootstrap

This project is part of my educational internship where I learned how to use the Bootstrap framework and applied it to create a responsive website. The goal was to build a website based on a provided layout, making it adaptive to various devices.

## Project Tasks:
1. Create a page based on a provided layout with fixed width.
2. Make the page responsive, so it looks good on different devices.
3. Host the page online using GitHub Pages.

## Features:
- Responsive layout with Bootstrap classes.
- Navigation menu collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- Static footer.
- First section covers the entire viewport height.
- Button color darkens by 10% on hover.
- Content scales according to the viewport width.
- Columns switch from 2/3 to a single column on smaller screens.

## Technologies:
- **HTML**: For the structure and content.
- **CSS**: For styling, including custom styles.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive layout and components.
